<h2>How to make Asun meat delicacies</h2>
<p>Asun is a peppered goat meat in Western part of Nigeria</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   <li> 2kg (2.6lbs) goat meat (cut with the skin)</li>
    <li> 2 habanero peppers (or to your taste)</li>
    <li> 1 medium onion</li>
    <li> 3 big stock cubes</li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon thyme</li>
    <li> Salt (to taste)</li>
    <li> 1 cooking spoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li> Black pepper (optional)</li>
    <li> 1 small green bell pepper</li>
    <li> 1 small red bell pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps or Methods of preparation</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Cut the goat meat into big chunks. Make sure you cut the chunks with the goat skin.</li>
    <li> Add the thyme and black pepper; rush and add the stock cubes. Feel free to add other spices and ingredients.</li>
    <li> Cover the bowl with a thin film. Put it in the fridge and leave to marinate for about an hour.</li>
    <li> After marinating the goat meat,put the meat in the pot.</li>
    <li> Pour water to just half of the level of the goat meat, add the big chunks of onions and start cooking at medium heat.</li>
    <li> Lay the goat meat flat on your oven rack.</li>
    <li> Grill/broil in the oven till the meat becomes brown all over. You will need to turn them from time to time</li>
    <li> When the meat is well grilled/broiled, heat the vegetable oil in a clean pot.</li>
    <li> Add the pepper and the thick stock from cooking the meat (if any) and fry for a bit.</li>
    <li> Add the grilled goat meat</li>
    <li> Stir very well till the pepper is even distributed on the goat meat. The vegetable oil ensures that this happens and gives the Asun a nice glow.</li>
    <li> Your Asun is ready</li>
